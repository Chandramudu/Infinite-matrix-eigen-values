        "\n",
        "The game begins with a brief introduction to Python fundamentals. This could include a short tutorial or a list of topics that will be covered in the quiz.\n",
        "Question Format: Each question should be presented in a multiple-choice format, with one correct answer and several incorrect options. The incorrect options should be plausible to ensure the game is challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Progression: The game could start with easier questions and gradually increase in difficulty. This would help players build their knowledge incrementally.\n",
        "Time Limit: Consider adding a time limit for each question to make the game more exciting. This would also encourage players to think quickly, a valuable skill in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Help Options: You could provide help options, such as hints or the ability to skip a question, which players can use a limited number of times.\n",
        "End of the Game: The game ends when the player has answered all the questions or if they choose to end the game prematurely.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Reward Mechanisms:\n",
        "Points: Award points for each correct answer. The number of points could be based on the difficulty of the question or how quickly the player answered.\n",
        "Levels: Players could progress through levels as they accumulate points. Each level could introduce more advanced Python topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Badges: Award badges for significant achievements, such as answering a certain number of questions correctly in a row, completing a level without any mistakes, or answering a question exceptionally quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard to foster a sense of competition. Players can strive to improve their ranking by earning more points.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Feedback: Provide constructive feedback when players answer a question incorrectly. This could include an explanation of the correct answer, which would turn a mistake into a learning opportunity."
